# Instancing into a collection

Leslie's note on (not) reusing TLA+ modules: [link](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/tlaplus/BHBNTkJ2QFE)

Possible ways of reusing spec with instancing:

1. Version that seems to be the most obvious, at first,
  from programming reusability perspective,
  but horribly complicated and inneficient - [link](TlaInstanceIntoCollection1.tla)

1. Version with functional style module - [link](TlaInstanceIntoCollection2.tla)

1. Version with extracting variables to separate file - [link](TlaInstanceIntoCollection3.tla)
